## Collaboration
To date, the project has been a collaborative effort between two developers. As the project evolves, we are transitioning the prototype to a new repository where it will be developed into a RESTful API application to support a React frontend. This transition is in response to our team's expansion, welcoming two junior frontend developers aiming to elevate the project to the next level.
